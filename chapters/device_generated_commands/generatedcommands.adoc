= Device-Generated Commands

This chapter discusses the generation of command buffer content on the
device, for which these principle steps are to be taken:

  * Define a layout describing the sequence of commands which should be
    generated.
  * Optionally set up device-bindable shaders.
  * Retrieve device addresses by flink:vkGetBufferDeviceAddressEXT for
    setting buffers on the device.
  * Fill one or more sname:VkBuffer with the appropriate content that gets
    interpreted by the command layout.
  * Create a `preprocess` sname:VkBuffer using the device-queried allocation
    information.
  * Optionally preprocess the input data in a separate action.
  * Generate and execute the actual commands.

The preprocessing step executes in a separate logical pipeline from either
graphics or compute.
When preprocessing commands in a separate step they must: be explicitly
synchronized against the command execution.
When not preprocessing in a separate step, the preprocessing is
automatically synchronized against the command execution.
