This proposal regards layering OpenGL over Vulkan, and addresses a discrepancy
where EGL is able to respond to certain queries before a surface is created,
while Vulkan requires a surface for corresponding queries.

== Problem Statement

An application using EGL can query the list of supported ``EGLConfig``s, based on
which it would create an `EGLSurface`.
Additionally, based on the availability of extensions, it can provide a
color space to `eglCreateWindowSurface` at the same time.

In Vulkan, the format and color space information are retrievable from the
`VkSurfaceKHR` through
link:{docs}chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR[`vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR`]
When layering OpenGL over Vulkan, there needs to be a way to query this
information before the surface is created.

Similarly, the OpenGL implementation layer needs to know:

- The supported present modes by the platform to be able to correctly expose
  the `EGL_KHR_mutable_render_buffer` extension,
- Whether protected surfaces are supported to be able to correctly expose the
  `EGL_EXT_protected_content` extension.

On some implementations and platforms, the surface formats, color spaces,
present modes and support for protected content are identical for every
surface, and such queries could in fact be answered before a surface is
created.

== Solution Space

Currently, no cross-platform solution is known to exist to support layering
OpenGL over Vulkan in this regard.

=== Surfaceless Queries

One solution is to modify the existing relevant queries to allow querying
without a link:{docs}chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkSurfaceKHR[`VkSurfaceKHR`].
This works on platforms where this information is truly global, which is
currently the case with Google's Android and SwiftShader.

Pros:

- Trivial to implement and use

Cons:

- Works only on some platforms, and cannot be implemented on all platforms.

== Proposal

In VK_GOOGLE_surfaceless_query, the first solution is adopted primarily to
accelerate producing working systems where OpenGL is layered on Vulkan.

With this extension, the `surface` parameter can be `VK_NULL_HANDLE` in the
following:

- link:{docs}chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR[`vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR`]
- link:{docs}chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR[`vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR`]
- `pSurfaceInfo->surface` passed to
  link:{docs}chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2KHR[`vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilities2KHR`]
  if
  link:{docs}chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkSurfaceProtectedCapabilitiesKHR[`VkSurfaceProtectedCapabilitiesKHR`]
  is chained to `pSurfaceCapabilities`.
  In this case, only the protected information is populated, while
  link:{docs}chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VkSurfaceCapabilities2KHR[`VkSurfaceCapabilities2KHR`]`::surfaceCapabilities`
  and any other chained structs will have undefined values.

In all the above situations, calling the function with any valid `surface`
parameter will produce identical results to calling it with `VK_NULL_HANDLE`.
